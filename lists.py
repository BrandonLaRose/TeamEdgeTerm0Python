 #  Use this program to learn about Python lists:
    
 #  1. Declare and store data in lists
 #  2. Access list data by index
 #  3. Modify list data by index
 #  4. Multi-dimensional lists (lists inside lists!)
 #  5. List methods: append() and pop()
 #  6. The length of the list - introduce conditionals
 #  7. Strings as sequences - join() split() 
 #  
 #  Follow the -->To Dos ! run the program to test often and debug
